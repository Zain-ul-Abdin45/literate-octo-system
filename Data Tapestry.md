# DATA WAREHOUSING METHODOLOGIES
In data management, businesses rely on various data sources and cater to a diverse set of data consumers. With this diversity comes a multitude of expectations regarding data accessibility, speed, cost-effectiveness, and clarity of usage.

## Normalized Model: Bill Inmon

Bill Inmon's normalized data warehousing model emphasizes the importance of structuring data efficiently. By organizing data into separate tables and minimizing redundancy, this model optimizes storage and ensures data consistency. It is a foundational approach for data warehousing.

## De-Normalized Model: Ralph Kimball

Ralph Kimball's de-normalized data warehousing model takes a different approach. It simplifies data access by consolidating related information into a single table. This denormalization enhances query performance and is particularly suited for analytical reporting.

Apart from these two well-known methodologies, there are other approaches to designing data warehousing systems:

- **Data Vault 2.0:** Data Vault 2.0 is an advanced modeling technique that excels in managing evolving data structures and complex business rules. It provides agility and scalability in data warehousing.

- **One Big Table (Flatten Straight Wide Table):** This methodology involves creating a single, comprehensive table that combines various data elements. While it simplifies querying, it may require careful management of data updates.

These methodologies serve as frameworks for structuring data to meet specific business needs. Choosing the right approach depends on factors like data complexity, reporting requirements, and scalability.

In the ever-evolving landscape of data management, understanding these methodologies is essential for building robust and efficient data warehousing solutions.
